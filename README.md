Realm LoginKit is a UI framework that provides a fully featured login screen for apps that make use of the Realm Mobile Platform.

It has been designed to be easily dropped into existing app codebases, and to provide a fully featured interface allowing users to either log in, or register new accounts in that app.

# Features
* Light & dark themes for light apps like Realm Draw, and dark apps like Realm Tasks.
* Fully adaptive to both smartphone, and tablet screen sizes.
* Easy swapping between 'log in' and 'sign up' modes.
* Optional settings to hide the server URL and 'remember me' form fields.
* The ability to remember username and passwords on subsequent app launches.

# Versions & Requirements

Realm LoginKit only supports iOS at the moment. 

### [iOS](https://github.com/realm-demos/realm-loginkit/tree/master/RealmLoginKit%20Apple/) 
* Xcode 8.0 and up
* iOS 9.0 and up

### Android 
Currently in development, and should be finished soon.

### Xamarin 
Currently on the roadmap with development starting soon.

# Third Party Dependencies

### iOS
* [Realm Objective-C](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/) - The Objective-C version of the Realm Mobile Database.
* [TORoundedTableView](https://github.com/TimOliver/TORoundedTableView) - A subclass of `UITableView` that creates rounded table sections when view on iPad.

# Example Code

### Swift

```swift
// Create the object
let loginController = LoginViewController(style: .lightTranslucent) // init() also defaults to lightTranslucent

// Configure any of the inputs before presenting it
loginController.serverURL = "localhost"

// Set a closure that will be called on successful login
loginController.loginSuccessfulHandler = { user in
	// Provides the successfully authenticated SyncUser object
}
```

### Objective-C

```objc
// Create the object
RLMLoginViewController *loginController = [[RLMLoginViewController alloc] initWithStyle:LoginViewControllerStyleLightTranslucent];

// Configure any of the inputs before presenting it
loginController.serverURL = @"localhost";

// Set a closure that will be called on successful login
loginController.loginSuccessfulHandler = ^(RLMSyncUser *user) {
	// Provides the successfully authenticated RLMSyncUser object
};
```

# Setting up the Demo App
### iOS
In order to run the Realm LoginKit demo app, it is necessary to install CocoaPods in order to integrate the third party libraries.

1. If you haven't already, [install CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
2. Open Terminal, and navigate to the root Realm Puzzle directory, e.g. `cd ~/Projects/realm-loginkit`.
3. Run `pod install` to install the necessary dependencies needed by Realm LoginKit.
4. Open `RealmLoginKit.xcworkspace` instead of the `xcproject` file.

# Installation

### iOS
#### CocoaPods
CocoaPods is the recommended way to install Realm LoginKit into an app as this will automatically manage recycling Realm Objective-C as a dependency. In your `PodFile`, simply add `pod 'RealmLoginKit'`.

#### Manually
You can also integrate Realm LoginKit manually; simply copy the `RealmLoginKit` folder to your app, and drag it into Xcode. That being said, you will also need to install the [dependencies](#third-party-dependencies) separately as well. See their respective GitHub repositories for installation instructions.
